Prophecy Book Boilerplate
=========================

Book boilerplate to generate books as EPUB, MOBI, and PDF from simple
Markdown text files. Or from HTML. Or from LaTeX. Or mixed.

Page layout, CSS typography, the format standards, TOC navPoints,
manifest, guide -- is the litany of pain.

Sounds like the machine should be doing this, and we can just go and
meditate on peace.

Add Screeshots.

Embedded fonts and CSS typography for the ebooks, and a LaTeX
documentclass for the PDF.
