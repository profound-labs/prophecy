# The Time Machine

The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)
was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and
twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The
fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent
lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed
and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents,
embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon,
and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought
roams gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it
to us in this way -- marking the points with a lean forefinger --
as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new
paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.

'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or
two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for
instance, they taught you at school is founded on a
misconception.'

[The Time Machine][1] by *H.G. Wells*, 1895
